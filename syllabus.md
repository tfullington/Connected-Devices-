# EECS 397 - Special Topics: Intro to Connected Devices
## Spring, 2017

Instructor:  Nick Barendt  nab2@case.edu (plus additional experts)   
Lecture Time:  Wednesdays 7:00-9:30 (possibly changing)
Location: White 322 (possibly changing)
TA: Andy Hennessy <ajb200@case.edu>
Office Hours:  By appointment and Slack [https://cwru-eecs397-spring17.slack.com](https://cwru-eecs397-spring17.slack.com)  

## Course Description
This course provides students with a practical, hands-on introduction to connected devices and systems (aka Internet of Things).  Student pairs design and build a complete connected device system, gaining hands-on experience with device (embedded), cloud/web, and mobile software development and wireless communication technologies.  Students also develop experience with non-functional, systems topics including analytics, scaling and load testing, remote device update, and essential security.  The course has a heavy lab component.

The course will be a hands-on introduction to building Connected Devices (aka Internet of Things) products and services.  This will, by necessity, involve a wide variety of programming languages, systems, and technologies.  Given the time constraints, none of these can be explored in detail, but we hope to impart an overall systems understanding of how Connected Device systems can be architected and built, as well as introduce students to each major systems component and concept.

We will be exploring this space through a simple hardware product, whose functionality will evolve throughout the semester, as we integrate it with "the cloud" and mobile applications, as well as explore related topics, such as security and analytics.

We hope that by the end of the semester students will:

* have developed a systems level understanding of Connected Devices
* have enough understanding to dive deeper into the technology of any of the components
* have sufficient experience to prototype a product or concept idea of their own

This a 3 Credit Hour course.

## Textbook
The materials for this course have been developed from scratch.  Students will access the courseware (source code, configuration, hypertext textbook in Markdown) via Git.

Knowledge of Linux, Git, and Python are recommended.

As a starting point, here are a few Git resources that might be useful:

* [Git SCM](https://git-scm.com/)
* [GitHub Hello World](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)

and a few Python resources that might be useful:

* [The Official Python Tutorial](http://docs.python.org/tutorial/)
* [Learn Python in 10 minutes](http://www.korokithakis.net/tutorials/python/)
* [Learn Python the hard way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/)

## Course Content and Requirements
Lectures will be given once per week.  Students are expected to attend all lectures and participate in discussions.  Students will be responsible for all material covered in class.  

We will be covering a wide variety of technologies, including Embedded Systems, Cloud (using Amazon Web Services - AWS), Bluetooth Low Energy (aka Bluetooth Smart) and native mobile applications, as well as non-functional systems topics including analytics, load testing, security, firmware update, etc.

## Grading Policy
(A: 90-100%, B: 80-90%, C: 70-80%, D: 60-70%, F: 0-60%)  
_curve possible at instructor's discretion_

There will be a weekly lab assignment, plus a Final Project, for a total of 14 assignments.  The Final Project will make up 10% of your grade, with the other weekly assignments being 90%.

The assignments will be challenging.

We strongly believe in the concept of Pairing as a useful practice for learning - two developers/designers/engineers working closely together, sharing a keyboard, talking through problems and possible solutions, and teaching and learning from each other.

Students will be paired for each assignment.

* Grading will be based on: 
    1.  A brief, in-class demonstration of the required functionality, plus a short video as a backup
    2.  A brief write-up, capturing relevant output (e.g., source code, photos/videos demonstrating required functionality, etc.)
    3.  Review of your software.
* Late assignments will not be accepted.
* All projects must conform to the guidelines given in the assignments (e.g., program name, particular function names, output format if specified, etc.).
* Students will work in pairs, and will receive the same grade for each assignment.
* If a student feel that their current pairing is not working, please contact the instructor _immediately_.

## Course Ethics and Policies:
* _All work turned in should be that of your own pair._
* Study groups are encouraged, but, again,
* _All work turned in should be your own pair._ 
* Neither copy another student's work nor allow your work to be copied, other than your pair.
* Please refer to the [University's Academic Integrity Standards](http://www.case.edu/provost/ugstudies/acintegrity.htm)
* Any malacious use or misuse of the development servers will be dealt with most harshly.  Its only proper use is learning C programming and the related tools (e.g., torrent servers, etc. are inappropriate).
